# Tikap

Tikap (might be pronounced like Teacup) is a conlang with five phonemes /p t k/ /ɨ ɐ/ (p t k i a). It's only goal is to make a functional language with this limited inventory.

In order to achieve this it tries to work with a small vocabulary and therefor oligosynthetic elements.

One very productive feature is its system of nonconcatenative morphology. In any root word consonants and vowels can be regrouped to form different patterns with new meaning. The order of consonants and the order of vowels however stays the same. Therefor the root word "tikap" can also have the forms "tkipa, tkiap, tikpa, itkap". Together with allophonic variation those five words can be pronounced quite different from each other [t͡ʃɨɣäɸ txəβʌ txəɐɸ t͡ʃɨxpʌ ɨskəɸ].

# Phonology
## Phonemes

/p t k/ /ɨ ɐ/

The syllable structure is (C)V(C) with CC Clusters possible word initial.

Example:  
/ptap.tik/

## Allophones

In general all allophony is optional, one might pronounce /tikap/ as [tikap], [tɨkɐp], [t͡ʃɨɣäɸ] or anything in between. As a register the basic variant is used in dictating, teaching and talking to learners of the language.

1. At the beginning of a word consonants are pronounced as their basic form [p t k]. Alternatively they might be aspirated [pʰ tʰ kʰ].
2. Between vowels they turn into their voiced version [β ɾ ɣ]. Alternatively they might just be voiced stops [b d g].
3. At the end of a word they turn into voiceless fricatives [ɸ s x].
4. Consonant clusters are realized voiceless as PF (Plosive, Fricative) word initial, and also voiceless FP in between vowels [ps px tɸ tx kɸ ks].
5. If a consonant or vowel is followed by itself it becomes geminated. 
6. If /t/ is followed by /ɨ/ it becomes [t͡ʃ] word initial, [ʃ] between vowels. At the end of a word, following /ɨ/ it also becomes [ʃ].
7. The vowels /ɨ ɐ/ get lowered to [ə ä] after /k/.
8. The vowels /ɨ ɐ/ get rounded to [y œ] or [u ʌ] (depending on speakers preference) after /p/.

## Stress

Stress tends to fall on heavy syllables. If there is only heavy syllable it falls on this one, for any case other than this stress is grammatical.

# Grammar
## Morphology
### Grouping

Within a root word the order of consonants is fixed, as is the order of vowels. They however can be grouped differently in the boundaries the syllable structure allows. That is, consonants can form clusters and vowels can form clusters, or both can be equally spread out.

## Word order

Word order is VSO.

## Oligosynthetic structures
### Verb serialization

Verbs can be stringed together to indicate successive actions.

Example:  
"steal run dog fish."  
The dog steals fish and runs away.

### Noun incorporation

To indicate an action that involves a specific object or instrument, the noun can be prefixed to the verb. Giving rise to constructions similar to the English "baby-sitting".

Example:  
"fish steal dog."  
The dog is fish-stealing.
