Phonology
---------

Phonemes
========

/p t k/ /ɨ ɐ/

The way phonemes can be ordered is limited by these rules:

* There can not be more than two consonants or vowels in a row.
* Word final there can at most be one consonant in the coda.

Usually the ratio of consonants and vowels in a root words is limited by `C = V ± 1` . Exceptions are possible.

Stress
======

Vowels and combinations of vowels constitute syllable nuclei. Primary stress can fall on either of those, preferable on VV parts if present.

Example:
patata > /'pa.ta.ta/ /pa'ta.ta/ /pa.ta'ta/
paatta > /'paat.ta/
apatta > /'a.pat.ta/ /a'pat.ta/ /a.pat'ta/
aptaat > /ap'taat/

Allophones
==========

In general all allophony is optional, one might pronounce /tikap/ as [tikap], [tɨkɐp], [tɨɣäɸ] or anything in between. As a register the basic variant is used in dictating, teaching and talking to learners of the language and linguists or when talking about parts of the language.

|                   | Bilabial | Alveolar | Velar   |
| ----------------- |:--------:|:--------:|:-------:|
| Plosive           | p        | t        | k       |
| Flap              |          | [ɾ]      |         |
| Fricative         | [ɸ] [β]  | [ʃ] [s]  | [x] [ɣ] |

|   |
|:-:|
| ɨ |
|[ə]|
| ɐ |
|[ä]|

1. At the beginning of a word consonants are pronounced as their basic form [p t k]. Alternatively they might be aspirated [pʰ tʰ kʰ].
2. Between vowels they turn into their voiced version [β ɾ ɣ]. Alternatively they might just be voiced stops [b d g].
3. At the end of a word they turn into voiceless fricatives [ɸ s x].
4. Consonant clusters are realized voiceless as PF (Plosive, Fricative) word initial, and also voiceless FP in between vowels [ps px tɸ tx kɸ ks].
5. If a consonant or vowel is followed by itself it becomes geminated. 
6. Two of the same consonants at the beginning of a word take the forms [ts pɸ kx].
6. If /t/ is followed by /ɨ/ it becomes [ʃ] in between vowels. At the end of a word, following /ɨ/ it also becomes [ʃ]. At the beginning of a word the cluster /tt/ becomes [tʃ] before /ɨ/.
7. The vowels /ɨ ɐ/ get lowered to [ə ä] after /k/.
8. The vowels /ɨ ɐ/ get rounded after /p/ (depending on speakers preference).

Because of the wide free variation possible the language is often slurred and spoken with so little effort, that to an untrained listener it might not sound like a complex system of communication at all.

Orthography
===========

Romanized orthography has two forms which differ in the way consonants are written. Vowels are < a i > usually.
If stress deviates from the predictable pattern it is marked with an accent on the first vowel of the syllable < á í >.

In it's basic form consonants are written as they are /p t k/ always as < p t k >.
The basic form is always used when talking about unaltered roots. e.g. "tikap"

The alternate form marks allophones. Voiceless [ɸ ʃ~s x] as < f s x > and voiced [β ɾ ɣ] as < v d g >. This is used in normal writing to differentiate words more easily. e.g. "tigaf"
Vowels are < o u > after /p/ and < a e > after /k/.

Example:  
tikap atki tipái  
tigaf aske tivóu  
[tɨɣäɸ ɐskə tɨβ'ɞʉ]

Grammar
-------

Word classes
============

* Closed class
  * Base verbs (usually transitive or ditransitive)
  * Narrative classifiers
  * Pronouns/Demonstratives
* Open class
  * Adjectives/descriptive verbs (usually intransitive or avalent)
  * Nouns

Adjectives and nouns can easily change into one other, differing mostly in their role in the sentence.


### Base verbs

*Inversion:*  
A smaller group of base verbs can be turned into a inverted form in which the subject becomes the object (*to ask* > *to answer*). This often also includes semantic changes.
Note that the inversion just changes the doer of the action, not it's connotation (*give a gift* > *steal*).  
Usually only used when the object is part of the "big animal" group. That is, some highly animate being to interact with. Indirect objects are unaffected.

The base verbs are:

* **talk** "taki"  
  Or any social interaction.
  inversion: listen
* **give a gift**  
  To give someone a gift is a highly regulated and formal act. It is therefor different form giving someone a tool at work or food because they are hungry.
  inversion: steal  
* **perceive**
  inversion: show, draw attention
* **ask, learn, think**
  inversion: answer, teach
* **go**
  inversion: move something

* **ingest**  
* **give, take, share, put down, pick up**  
  Change the location or owner of an object (without any formality).
* **hold, hug, care**
* **affect** "akita"  
  hit, chop, break, burn
* **use**
* **create, plant, cook**
* **use mouth** "pipiti"  
  In any way that's not talking or eating. Spit, lick, kiss, smile, utter random noise.


### Narrative classifiers

The classifiers (CL) in tikap shouldn't be compared with the ones on finds in many Asian and Austronesian languages. Instead they are inspired by the classifier handshapes used in ASL and many other sign languages. Their main purpose in tikap is to replace actors in a narrative. Thereby they take the place third person pronouns normally take in English narratives. "*He* wondered where the mountain came form. *It* wasn't there the last time *he* visited."

They are usually used in conjunction with pronouns/demonstratives. In the order:

adjective/relative clause - demonstrative/pronoun - classifier

The main categories are:

* **Big animals**  
  Any kind of animal that can be an actor equivalent to humans. Or is capable to recognize a human as a separate entity. Animals one can interact with.  
  Humans, pets, mammals, birds, reptiles, large fish, heads
* **Small animals**  
  Any kind of animal that does not recognize humans.  
  Insects, words, snails, small fish, mushrooms, anemone, microbes
* **Pair**  
  Thing that usually occur in pairs of two or any other small limited number. Some of which English uses the plural by default.  
  Eyes, ears, arms, shears, pants, glasses
* **Long**  
  Long and thin things in general.  
  Fingers, as single arm, branches, rivers, ropes, hair
* **Flat**  
  Surfaces and sheets.  
  Plot of land, paper, paintings, walls
* **Container and their content**  
  Things that serve the purpose of a container or are inside one.  
  Teacups, bottles, bags, vehicles, liquid in a container, passengers, gases under pressure, information storage devices
* **Compact**  
  Any kind of lump or object that does not fall in the other categories.  
  Stones, logs, tools.
* **Thing**  
  General classifier for countable nouns.  
  Did you get the thingy form the thingy for the thingy?
* **Stuff**  
  General classifier for uncountable nouns. Includes abstract concepts like time.  
  I better put more stuff of the stuff into the stuff.

Classifiers that may or may not be added: Plants, Food, Tools, Places, Networks (Language, social relations, internet)

Which CL to use also depends on the context. If a book falls on your head you would use Compact, if you quote from it, it is a Container.

There are two main forms:

* *CL:* When used to classify a noun they end with a vowel.
* *Narrative:* When used on their own they begin and end in a consonant.

To talk about a classifier in an abstract sense (as in "I don't know when to use the Stuff-CL") they get prefixed with the Thing-CL.


### Copula, Pronouns, Demonstratives

Pronouns, demonstratives and names can be used as a copula.
The third person pronouns are demonstratives at the same time.
The "all" pronoun may refer to a general group or abstract concepts. e.g. "Time runs so fast, *it* is always ahead of me."

|pronoun|Gloss     |English |
|-----|------------|--------|
|     | 1.s        | I      |
|     | 1.p        | we     |
|     | 2.s        | you    |
|     | 2.p        | you all|
|     | inc.dual   | you and me |
|     | inc.p      | we     |
|     | 3.proximal | this/they here |
|     | 3.distal   | that/they there |
|     | 3.absent   | they who are not here |
|     |            | all |


### Adjectives/descriptive verbs

Adjectives can in their base form be translated as "to be x", in transitive sentences "to cause something to be x". To make it transitive it is usually combined with base verbs, while omitting the base verb is common when the context is clear.  

*be sleeping* & *put down* > bring someone to bed


### Nouns

Nouns are boring. Therefor classifiers take their place as often as possible.


Morphology
==========

### Grouping

"Grouping" changes the way consonants and vowel form clusters. Within a root word the order of consonants is fixed, as is the order of vowels. They however can be grouped differently into different syllables.

The root word is written in a CVCV... pattern if possible.
For the word "kitap" consonants are: "ktp" and vowels are: "ia".

    C:    k_t_p   kt_p_   k_tp_   _kt_p   kt__p
    V:    _i_a_   __i_a   _i__a   i__a_   __ia_
    Word: kitap   ktipa   kitpa   iktap   ktiap

Therefor, for every number of consonants and vowels a root can have there are several patterns the phonology allows.

CV VC (ti it)  
CCV CVC (tki tik)  
CVV VCV VVC (tia ita iat)  
CVCV CCVV VCCV VCVC CVVC (tika tkia itka itak tiak)  
CVCVC CCVCV CCVVC CVCCV VCCVC (tikap tkipa tkiap tikpa itkap)  
VCVCV VVCVC VVCCV VCVVC CVVCV CVCVV VCCVV  
...

Grouping has two main purposes. First to add affixes (see section on affixes), second to indicate which grammatical role the words take in a sentence. For the purpose of marking the grammatical role the core principle is the sonority hierarchy - applied to different scales. In it's simplest form it states that the louder sounds tend to be the center of an element. In the case of tikap /ɨ ɐ/ are more sonorous and /p t k/ are less sonorous. For a syllable this gives a shape of e.g. "kap". One can also apply it to words and therefor have "tikap" instead of "itkpa". Extending it up to the phrase or sentence level we can generate a set of rules on how the individual words should ideally look like.
Because of the VSO word order verbs tend to be at the beginning of sentences, they therefor begin with a consonant. Classifiers can start a noun phrase, when they end in a vowel the listener knows that there is something to follow. In contrast, when the CL ends in a consonant the listener know it stands on its own.
In this way, the sonority patterns produced by grouping resemble intonation patterns.

Note that, because affixes "agree" with the root word they mirror the forms. A root word ending in a consonant will more likely also end in a consonant even with affixes attached. e.g. ika*t* pi -ka > ikatipa*k*


### Affixes

When an affix gets added to a word, the word retains its form, the affix however may change to avoid clusters becoming to large. If it is somehow not possible and a consonant or vowel is needed, the previous consonant or vowel is echoed.  
Example:  
tik- ptaik > tkiptaik  
katia -apa > katiapaa
tpik- ptaik > tpik*i*ptaik
katia -apaa > katia*t*apaa


### Number and Definiteness

All nouns are undefined in their number. When a noun is used with a classifier but no number word it is singular. For any other number than one or zero a classifier is needed.
A classifier also makes a noun more definite.


### Possession

To indicate, in a declarative sentence, something is in someones possession the pronoun for the person in question is used like a copula before the possessed noun. *You arm* "This is your arm."  
A possessed word just uses the same construction with the pronoun as prefix. *youarm*


### Evidence and Tense

These prefixes attach to base verbs and demonstratives.
There is no explicit tense marking, but direct and indirect evidence also imply a non-future tense (present or past).

* Direct evidence: **pi-** own experience, perception, self evident truth
* Indirect evidence: **tat-** reported speech, reasoning, inferring
* Non-evidence: *unmarked* reported-reported speech, made up stories, guessing, questions

Word order
==========

### Basic word order

Default word order is Verb Subject Object Indirect-object (VSOI).
But it can change to IVSO, or OVS through noun incorporation.


### Verb serialization

Base verbs can be stringed together to indicate successive actions. Note that a descriptive verb + a base verb just narrows down the meaning of the base verb.

Example:  
*take go dog fish*  
The dog steals fish and runs away.


### Noun incorporation

To indicate an action that involves a specific object or instrument, the noun can be prefixed to the verb. Giving rise to constructions similar to the English "baby-sitting".

Example:  
*fish take dog*  
The dog is fish-taking.
