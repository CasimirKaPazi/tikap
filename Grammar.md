Phonology
---------

Phonemes
========

/p t k/ /ɨ ɐ/

The way phonemes can be ordered is limited by these rules:

* There can not be more than two consonants or vowels in a row.
* Word final there can at most be one consonant in the coda.

Usually the ratio of consonants and vowels in a root words is limited by `C = V ± 1` . Exceptions are possible.

Stress
======

Vowels and combinations of vowels constitute syllable nuclei. Primary stress can fall on either of those, preferable on VV parts if present.

Example:
patata > /'pa.ta.ta/ /pa'ta.ta/ /pa.ta'ta/
paatta > /'paat.ta/
apatta > /'a.pat.ta/ /a'pat.ta/ /a.pat'ta/
aptaat > /ap'taat/

Allophones
==========

In general all allophony is optional, one might pronounce /tikap/ as [tikap], [tɨkɐp], [tɨɣäɸ] or anything in between. As a register the basic variant is used in dictating, teaching and talking to learners of the language.

|                   | Bilabial | Alveolar | Velar   |
| ----------------- |:--------:|:--------:|:-------:|
| Plosive           | p        | t        | k       |
| Flap              |          | [ɾ]      |         |
| Fricative         | [ɸ] [β]  | [ʃ] [s]  | [x] [ɣ] |

|   |
|:-:|
| ɨ |
|[ə]|
| ɐ |
|[ä]|

1. At the beginning of a word consonants are pronounced as their basic form [p t k]. Alternatively they might be aspirated [pʰ tʰ kʰ].
2. Between vowels they turn into their voiced version [β ɾ ɣ]. Alternatively they might just be voiced stops [b d g].
3. At the end of a word they turn into voiceless fricatives [ɸ s x].
4. Consonant clusters are realized voiceless as PF (Plosive, Fricative) word initial, and also voiceless FP in between vowels [ps px tɸ tx kɸ ks].
5. If a consonant or vowel is followed by itself it becomes geminated. 
6. Two of the same consonants at the beginning of a word take the forms [ts pɸ kx].
6. If /t/ is followed by /ɨ/ it becomes [ʃ] in between vowels. At the end of a word, following /ɨ/ it also becomes [ʃ]. At the beginning of a word the cluster /tt/ becomes [tʃ] before /ɨ/.
7. The vowels /ɨ ɐ/ get lowered to [ə ä] after /k/.
8. The vowels /ɨ ɐ/ get rounded after /p/ (depending on speakers preference).

Morphology

### Grouping

"Grouping" changes the way consonants and vowel form clusters. Within a root word the order of consonants is fixed, as is the order of vowels. They however can be grouped differently into different syllables.
Therefor, for every number of consonants and vowels a root can have there are several patterns the phonology allows.

CV VC (ti it)  
CCV CVC (tki tik)  
CVV VCV VVC (tia ita iat)  
CVCV CCVV VCCV VCVC CVVC (tika tkia itka itak tiak)  
CVCVC CCVCV CCVVC CVCCV VCCVC (tikap tkipa tkiap tikpa itkap)  
VCVCV VVCVC VVCCV VCVVC CVVCV CVCVV VCCVV  
...

Word order
==========

### Basic word order

Default word order is Verb Subject Object Indirect-object (VSOI).
But it can change to IVSO, or OVS through noun incorporation.

### Copula, Pronouns, Demonstratives

Pronouns, demonstratives and names can be used as a copula.
The third person pronouns are demonstratives at the same time.
The "all" pronoun may refer to a general group or abstract concepts. e.g. "Time runs so fast, *it* is always ahead of me."

|pronoun|Gloss     |English |
|-----|------------|--------|
|     | 1.s        | I      |
|     | 1.p        | we     |
|     | 2.s        | you    |
|     | 2.p        | you all|
|     | inc.dual   | you and me |
|     | inc.p      | we     |
|     | 3.proximal | this/they here |
|     | 3.distal   | that/they there |
|     | 3.absent   | they who are not here |
|     |            | all |

### Narrative classifiers

The classifiers (CL) in tikap shouldn't be compared with the ones on finds in many asian and austronesian languages. Instead they are inspired by the classifier handshapes used in ASL and many other sign languages. Their main purpose in tikap is to replace actors in a narrative. Thereby they take the place third person pronouns normally take in english narratives. "*He* wondered where the mountain came form. *It* wasn't there the last time *he* visited."

They are usually used in conjunction with pronouns/demonstratives. In the order:

adjective/relative clause - demonstrative/pronoun - classifier

The main categories are:

* **Big animals**  
  Any kind of animal that can be an actor equivalent to humans. Or is capable to recognize a human as a separate entity. Animals one can interact with.  
  Humans, pets, mammals, birds, reptiles, large fish, heads
* **Small animals**  
  Any kind of animal that does not recognize humans.  
  Insects, words, snails, small fish, mushrooms, anemone, microbes
* **Pair**  
  Thing that usually occur in pairs of two or any other small limited number. Some of which English uses the plural by default.  
  Eyes, ears, arms, shears, pants, glasses
* **Long**  
  Long and thin things in general.  
  Fingers, as single arm, branches, rivers, ropes, hair
* **Flat**  
  Surfaces and sheets.  
  Plot of land, paper, paintings, walls
* **Container and their content**  
  Things that serve the purpose of a container or are inside one.  
  Teacups, bottles, bags, vehicles, liquid in a container, passengers, gases under pressure, information storage devices
* **Compact**  
  Any kind of lump or object that does not fall in the other categories.  
  Stones, logs, tools.
* **Thing**  
  General classifier for countable nouns.
  Did you get the thingy form the thingy for the thingy?
* **Stuff**
  General classifier for uncountable nouns. Includes abstract concepts like time.
  I better put more stuff of the stuff into the stuff.

Classifiers that may or may not be added: Plants, Food, Tools, Places, Networks (Language, social relations, internet)

Which CL to use also depends on the context. If a book falls on your head you would use Compact, if you quote from it, it is a Container.

### Verb serialization

Verbs can be stringed together to indicate successive actions.

Example:  
"steal run dog fish."  
The dog steals fish and runs away.

### Noun incorporation

To indicate an action that involves a specific object or instrument, the noun can be prefixed to the verb. Giving rise to constructions similar to the English "baby-sitting".

Example:  
"fish steal dog."  
The dog is fish-stealing.
