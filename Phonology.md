Phonology
---------

Phonemes
========

/p t k/ /ɨ ɐ/

The way phonemes can be ordered is limited by these rules:

* There can not be more than two consonants or vowels in a row.
* Word final there can at most be one consonant in the coda.

Usually the ratio of consonants and vowels in a root words is limited by `C = V ± 1` . Exceptions are possible.

Stress
======

Vowels and combinations of vowels constitute syllable nuclei. Primary stress can fall on either of those, preferable on VV parts if present.

Example:
patata > /'pa.ta.ta/ /pa'ta.ta/ /pa.ta'ta/
paatta > /'paat.ta/
apatta > /'a.pat.ta/ /a'pat.ta/ /a.pat'ta/
aptaat > /ap'taat/

Allophones
==========

In general all allophony is optional, one might pronounce /tikap/ as [tikap], [tɨkɐp], [tɨɣäɸ] or anything in between. As a register the basic variant is used in dictating, teaching and talking to learners of the language and linguists or when talking about parts of the language.

| ----------------- |:--------:|:--------:|:-------:|
| Plosive           | p        | t        | k       |
| Flap              |          | [ɾ]      |         |
| Fricative         | [ɸ] [β]  | [ʃ] [s]  | [x] [ɣ] |

1. At the beginning of a word consonants are pronounced as their basic form [p t k]. Alternatively they might be aspirated [pʰ tʰ kʰ].
2. Between vowels they turn into their voiced version [β ɾ ɣ]. Alternatively they might just be voiced stops [b d g].
3. At the end of a word they turn into voiceless fricatives [ɸ s x].
4. Consonant clusters are realized voiceless as PF (Plosive, Fricative) word initial, and also voiceless FP in between vowels [ps px tɸ tx kɸ ks].
5. If a consonant or vowel is followed by itself it becomes geminated. 
6. Two of the same consonants at the beginning of a word take the forms [ts pɸ kx].
6. If /t/ is followed by /ɨ/ it becomes [ʃ] in between vowels. At the end of a word, following /ɨ/ it also becomes [ʃ]. At the beginning of a word the cluster /tt/ becomes [tʃ] before /ɨ/.
7. The vowels /ɨ ɐ/ get lowered to [ə ä] after /k/.
8. The vowels /ɨ ɐ/ get rounded after /p/ (depending on speakers preference).

Because of the wide free variation possible the language is often slurred and spoken with so little effort, that to an untrained listener it might not sound like a complex system of communication at all.

Orthography
===========

Romanized orthography has two forms which differ in the way consonants are written. Vowels are < a i > usually.
If stress deviates from the predictable pattern it is marked with an accent on the first vowel of the syllable < á í >.

In it's basic form consonants are written as they are /p t k/ always as < p t k >.
The basic form is always used when talking about unaltered roots. e.g. "tikap"

The alternate form marks allophones. Voiceless [ɸ ʃ~s x] as < f s x > and voiced [β ɾ ɣ] as < v d g >. This is used in normal writing to differentiate words more easily. e.g. "tigaf"
Vowels are < o u > after /p/ and < a e > after /k/.

Example:  
tikap atki tipái  
tigaf aske tivóu  
[tɨɣäɸ ɐskə tɨβ'ɞʉ]
